It's generally preferable to use the official DAU reporting definition when possible; this metric exists only for cases where reporting client_id is required (e.g. for experiments). This metric needs to be aggregated by submission_date . If it is not aggregated by submission_date , it is similar to a \"days of use\" metric, and not DAU.
